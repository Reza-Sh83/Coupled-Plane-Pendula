    "### Explanation of the Plot Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Animation of Masses and Modes:**\n",
    "The main plot you're generating shows the oscillation of multiple masses that are coupled by springs, and it does so in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"All modes\" plot (combined motion):**\n",
    "  - This plot represents the **total motion of all masses** in the system as a sum of their individual normal modes.\n",
    "  - Over time, you see how the positions of all masses change together. The total motion shows the **overall displacement** of each mass, as if all normal modes are interacting and contributing to the motion.\n",
    "  - The motion is oscillatory and reflects the fact that the system of coupled masses is undergoing **harmonic oscillations**, influenced by both the spring constants and masses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Individual Mode Plots:**\n",
    "  - For each **mode (mode 1, mode 2, etc.)**, you see a separate plot that shows the **motion of the masses** as they oscillate in that particular mode.\n",
    "  - Each **mode** corresponds to a specific frequency and pattern of movement that is characteristic of the system's natural vibrations. In these plots:\n",
    "    - **Mode 1**: Typically, all masses move in unison (in-phase) with the same displacement, but possibly with different magnitudes.\n",
    "    - **Mode 2**: The masses might oscillate **out of phase**, meaning that some masses move in opposite directions. For example, the masses at the ends might move in one direction, while the masses in the middle move in the opposite direction.\n",
    "    - Higher modes (mode 3, mode 4, etc.) involve more complex patterns where the masses move with different phase shifts and amplitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **What You See in the Animation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spring Visualization:**\n",
    "  - The masses are shown as points (denoted by 'o'), and these points move according to their oscillations. The springs between the masses create a visual connection between them, which helps you understand how the coupling works.\n",
    "  - As the animation plays, you see each mass moving back and forth. The **relative movement** between the masses reflects the **force transmission** through the springs. This motion is determined by the normal modes of vibration, which are essentially the natural ways the masses can move when disturbed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mode-specific Motion:**\n",
    "  - As each mode is displayed in the animation, you'll see different patterns of motion. For example:\n",
    "    - In **mode 1**, all masses might move in the same direction at the same time (or with slight variations if the masses have different spring constants or masses).\n",
    "    - In **mode 2**, the masses could move in alternating directions: the leftmost mass might move in one direction, the middle mass in the opposite direction, and the rightmost mass in yet another direction.\n",
    "    - Higher modes have more complex, often sinusoidal, oscillations where different parts of the system may oscillate with different amplitudes and phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overall Behavior:**\n",
    "  - The combined motion (shown in the \"All modes\" plot) is the result of **adding up** the individual mode motions. The total motion reflects how the system behaves as a whole, considering all normal modes simultaneously. You can imagine it as a **superposition** of simple harmonic motions (each corresponding to a different mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Key Observations During Animation:**\n",
    "- The animation helps visualize the **evolution of the system over time**. You’ll notice that the masses oscillate in patterns that are dictated by the system’s natural frequencies.\n",
    "- The frequencies and amplitude relationships between the masses in different modes give you an insight into how the system behaves based on its physical properties (such as mass and spring constants).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  For example, if the masses have different spring constants (`k1, k2, ...`), the oscillations might appear more complex or irregular because each mode will involve different restoring forces acting on each mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Interpretation of the \"All modes\" Plot:**\n",
    "- The plot that shows the motion of all modes together represents the **combined oscillation** of the system. The total displacement of the masses at any given time is a result of all the modes contributing to the system’s motion.\n",
    "  - **At certain moments in time**, you may see the masses move more strongly in some directions, indicating that those particular normal modes have higher amplitudes at those times.\n",
    "  - The **total motion** will often be a more complex oscillation compared to the simple oscillations in individual modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "- The animation illustrates how the coupled masses oscillate, both individually and as a system. It shows the normal mode frequencies and how these modes contribute to the overall motion.\n",
    "- Each mode displays a unique pattern of oscillation, and the combined motion of all modes gives a comprehensive view of how the entire system behaves dynamically.\n"
